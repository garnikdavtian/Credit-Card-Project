Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The focus is on addressing the class imbalance problem typical in fraud detection datasets, utilizing advanced techniques such as SMOTE and model optimization through GridSearchCV.

Objectives
Analyze and preprocess the credit card transaction data.
Implement models to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
Improve model performance on the minority class (fraudulent transactions).
Evaluate the effectiveness of the models using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization.
xgboost for building the XGBoost classifier.
scikit-learn for machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
imblearn for handling imbalanced datasets with SMOTE.
joblib for model serialization.
Data Description
The dataset consists of 284,807 transactions, with 31 features including transaction amount and anonymized variables. The target variable ('Class') indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

Methodology
Data Exploration: Initial inspection of data shape and structure, checking for null values, and visualizing potential noise.
Data Splitting: The data was split into training and testing sets (80/20).
Handling Imbalance: SMOTE was applied to balance the training data.
Model Implementation:
XGBoost classifier was trained and evaluated.
Random Forest classifier was implemented and tuned.
Hyperparameter Optimization: GridSearchCV was utilized to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
Model Evaluation: Classification reports and confusion matrices were generated to assess model performance. ROC-AUC analysis was conducted to further evaluate model robustness.
